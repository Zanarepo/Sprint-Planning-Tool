        <p className="mb-4">
          Product Discovery is a critical phase in product management. Itâ€™s the process of understanding and validating what you should build, for whom, and whyâ€”before you invest significant time and resources in development. Think of it as the "research and planning" phase that helps ensure you create a product that people truly need and love.

          <FaSearch className="text-blue-500 mr-2" /> What is Product Discovery?
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Product Discovery is the methodical process of exploring ideas and gathering insights to define a productâ€™s direction. It involves:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Identifying Opportunities:</strong> Uncovering user needs, pain points, and market gaps.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Validating Assumptions:</strong> Testing ideas through customer feedback, prototypes, or experiments.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Defining the Problem:</strong> Clearly stating the problem youâ€™re trying to solve.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Exploring Solutions:</strong> Brainstorming potential solutions and assessing which will deliver the best outcomes.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Example:</strong> Imagine youâ€™re thinking about building a fitness tracking app. Through product discovery, you might learn that many users are frustrated with how their current apps donâ€™t integrate well with wearable devices or offer personalized workout plans. This insight directs you to build a product that uniquely addresses these pain points.

        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Product Discovery should be done:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Before Development:</strong> Always start with discovery to validate that the idea is worth building.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>When Entering a New Market:</strong> Use discovery to understand unique needs of a new audience.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>When Pivoting:</strong> If your current product isnâ€™t performing as expected, discovery helps determine if a pivot is needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Continuously:</strong> Even after launch, ongoing discovery refines and evolves your product based on real feedback.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Example:</strong> A startup developing an e-commerce platform might use product discovery early on to determine which features (like one-click checkout or personalized recommendations) would most improve the shopping experience.
